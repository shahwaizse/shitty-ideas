make a voice assistant that starts when your computer starts, and can open apps when you tell it to.
steps:
-listen for voice
-speech to text
-two parts of command:
	first part will be 'open', 'close', etc. this will be the context of the command.
	second part of the command will be the specification, such as an app name, or computer, etc.
-when the command has been recognized by code, do ooga booga stuff to make computer do your bidding
-maybe try incorporating windows search, or an external search API to make your assistant more smart?
-incorporate face recognition in it in some way? (not face detection, but like actual face recognition):
	upon hearing a command, the assistant could open the camera and try to recognize my face
	if my face is recognized, then the command will execute, if not then assistant will display quirky error dialogue.
-there's tons of text-to-speech bots, maybe my assistant could talk!

languages I could do this in:
	python: the easy way out, for bitch boys who don't know how to write code.
	csharp: michael reeves used to use this for literally everything so how hard can it be.
	c++: nightmare nightmare nightmare nightmare nightmare nightma............. 
	dart: because flutter is hip and fly
	(kind of want a spinny color picker to choose my fate but im afraid it'll choose nightmare nightmare nightmare nightmare nightmare nigh.....)

i was super enthusiastic about this project while writing this but this is seeming more daunting the more i research it
